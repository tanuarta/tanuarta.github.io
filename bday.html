          Happy Birthday Bubba!! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³
          You're 21 now! That means you can finally drink in America ðŸ˜³. I wonder if by this time we'll be able to go out, and if
          that's the case maybe I'll see you later today even though it's a Saturday; I'll come up with an excuse to see you maybe
          since we've been in lockdown for so long. But even if I don't see you today, don't worry! I'm ready to spoil you for the
          whole day. I'll be your entertainment, your personal slave and even your token kpop boyfriend anything you want really.
        </p>
        <p>
          You know, since you're 21 and we've been together for almost 5 years now, that means that I've been your boyfriend for
          almost a quarter of your life (and mine) that's pretty crazy huh? I'm so lucky to be able to have someone like you who
          can always make me laugh, dumb jokes become funny coming from you. You make me so happy from just being yourself and the
          best part is you accept me for just who I am. I'm so comfortable around you, you've seen my good sides and my bad sides
          and you love me for all of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes it's hard for me to understand when you talk about your insecurities. It hurts me to see you experience these
          moments of low self-esteem because to me you're so amazing. I love your art, the drawings you do of us remind me of how
          blessed I am that you're my girlfriend. You compare yourself too often with people in social media, comparing their best
          to your worst. I see improvement in your work, and I see the care that you put into it. I see someone who puts their
          best efforts to create something they're proud of, someone who's passionate about their art and won't settle for nothing
          less but perfection. An artist who knows their skill and is disappointed when it's not reflected in her work. I hope
          that one day you'll see how special you are and use the imperfections in your work as a motivation to improve, instead
          of comparing yourself to others to doubt your ability in improving.
        </p>
        <p>
          This letter took longer to write because I kept crying in the middle of it. I always cry a lot when I think about us.
          Thinking about us together in highschool, thinking about the dates that we've been in, it really, really reminds me of
          how special you are to me. Not seeing you for a while has really made me take you for granted. I hope today you can be
          reminded of the times where we used to message each other till we sleep on facebook. The days where we would sleep while
          calling each other. The days where we were less busy and had more time for each other. The days where I would send you
          memes I found on google through facebook to make you laugh. The days where we would play stardew valley for hours.
          Because you deserve it after all this stress from school! Mmmmmmmmwah
        </p>
        <p>
          Hopefully you'll see all this you're not in a call with me cause I'll be too embarrassed hehe.
          
          I love you.
